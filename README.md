QUESTION 1:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in basic Java concepts. Eg., Write a program to read the First name and Last name of a person, his weight and height using command line arguments. Calculate the BMI Index which is defined as the individual's body mass divided by the square of their height.

QUESTION 2:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in multidimensional arrays and looping constructs. Eg., If there are 4 batches in BTech(IT) learning ‘ITE2005’ course, read the count of the slow learners (who have scored <25) in each batch. Tutors should be assigned in the ratio of 1:4 (For every 4 slow learners, there should be one tutor). Determine the number of tutors for each batch. Create a 2-D jagged array with 4 rows to store the count of slow learners in the 4 batches. The number of columns in each row should be equal to the number of groups formed for that particular batch ( Eg., If there are 23 slow learners in a batch, then there should be 6 tutors and in the jagged array, the corresponding row should store 4, 4, 4, 4, 4,3). Use for-each loop to traverse the array and print the details. Also print the number of batches in which all tutors have exactly 4 students.

QUESTION 3:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in String handling. Eg., Write a program to read a chemical equation and find out the count of the reactants and the products. Also display the count of the number of molecules of each reactant and product.
Eg., For the equation, 2NaOH + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4+ 2H2O, the O/P should be as follows.
Reactants are 2 moles of NaOH, 1 mole of H2SO4.
Products are 1 mole of Na2SO4 and 2 moles of H2O.

QUESTION 4:
Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in advanced concepts of Java string handling. Eg., (Bioinformatics: finding genes) Biologists use a sequence of letters A, C, T, and G to model a genome. A gene is a substring of a genome that starts after a triplet ATG and ends before a triplet TAG, TAA, or TGA. Furthermore, the length of a gene string is a multiple of 3 and the gene does not contain any of the triplets ATG, TAG, TAA, and TGA. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a genome and displays all genes in the genome. If no gene is found in the input sequence, displays no gene. Here are the sample runs: 
Enter a genome string: TTATGTTTTAAGGATGGGGCGTTAGTT
O/P: TTT
GGGCGT
